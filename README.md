# Simple Linear AI

This project is a Python-based AI that demonstrates **Gradient Descent** and the **Learning Curve**.

## How it works
The AI learns to solve the equation $y = 2x$. 
* It starts with a **random weight**.
* It calculates the **Mean Squared Error** (how wrong it is).
* It uses **Gradient Descent** to nudge the weight closer to 2 after every "study session" (epoch).

## Learning Curve
As the training progresses, the error drops significantly. This creates a "curve" where the AI moves from guessing to high accuracy.
